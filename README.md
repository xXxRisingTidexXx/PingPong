# PingPong
It's a classic 2D game, where you're to hit the ball using paddle.
Use left and right arrows to move your tool. Score, compete and survive!

# v0.0.2
- Main menu has been fully implemented;
- Info menu has been implemented;
- RM (ResourceManager) and WM (WidgetManager) classes has been added;
- Game class has been partially implemented.
Now PingPong seems to look like a very simple game. It has chained game loop and more or less stable menus. Soon I'll
add Summary class to estimate player's statistics and results  in InfoMenu table. Also I gonna extend and embellish
UI via adding score counter, extra game objects and background decorations.

# v0.0.1
- Main menu has been partially implemented;
- Help menu has been implemented.
